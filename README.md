analysis of O2 and D14C sensitivites to soft tissue and disequilibrium pumps in CM2Mc, with application to last glacial maximum
uses CM2Mc model output and DIC decomposition from egglestone and galbraith 2018
full model output and code available: https://earthsystemdynamics.org/models/cm2mc-simulation-library/ 

input file is vol weighted annual means of deep ocean (>1.5 km)
- cm2mc_o2_c14_dic_soft_dis_deep_avg_export_Fe.csv

input file of proxy D14C and O2 data from LGM 
- proxy_o2_d14c_so2.csv

R code to perform analysis
- lgm_dis_soft_v1.R
