# CM2Mc_dis_soft_LGM
analysis of O2 and D14C sensitivites to soft tissue and disequilibrium pumps in CM2Mc Earth System Model, with inversion using LGM proxy data
* uses CM2Mc model output and DIC decomposition from egglestone and galbraith 2018, with full model output and code available: https://earthsystemdynamics.org/models/cm2mc-simulation-library/. input file with vol weighted annual means of deep ocean (>1.5 km) from CM2Mc simulations - cm2mc_o2_c14_dic_soft_dis_deep_avg_export_Fe.csv
* input file of proxy D14C and O2 data from LGM - proxy_o2_d14c_so2_14c_rafter_err.csv
* R code to perform model output regressions and LGM inversion and error propagarion - lgm_dis_soft_v1.1.R
* output files and figures are also provided
