analysis of O2 and D14C sensitivites to soft tissue and disequilibrium pumps in CM2Mc, with application to last glacial maximum

- uses CM2Mc model output and DIC decomposition from egglestone and galbraith 2018, with full model output and code available: https://earthsystemdynamics.org/models/cm2mc-simulation-library/. input file with vol weighted annual means of deep ocean (>1.5 km) from CM2Mc simulations - cm2mc_o2_c14_dic_soft_dis_deep_avg_export_Fe.csv

- input file of proxy D14C and O2 data from LGM - proxy_o2_d14c_so2.csv

- R code to perform model output regressions and LGM inversion - lgm_dis_soft_v1.R

- output files and figures are also provided
